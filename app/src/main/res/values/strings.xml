    <string name="home_desc">The University of Calicut is the largest University in Kerala. Established in the year 1968, it is the second university to be set up in Kerala. The University aims to nurture excellence in education and research in its catchment areas of Northern Kerala, historically consigned to the periphery of Kerala’s academic map. The University lays its emphasis on fostering quality human resource and promoting productive research that benefit both local communities and wider humanity.The University was created through a Government plan bifurcating Kerala University. As per the plan, the four post-graduate departments of the University of Kerala operating in Calicut were annexed to the new University along with fifty four constituent colleges spread across seven northern districts. With ‘Nirmaya Karmana Sree’ as it motto, the University has been able to surmount all challenges and emerge as the largest residential cum affiliating University in Kerala. With 30 post graduate departments and 373 affiliated colleges it has become a beacon of hope and enlightenment for hundreds of thousands of young men and women in North Kerala.</string>

    <string name="vc_msg">University of Calicut is a prestigious educational organisation. It has created a niche of its own among the universities around the globe. This University, as you know is the second oldest and the largest of all the other universities of Kerala.

Our university is mighty enough to satisfy the educational aspirations of a large number of rural, semi-urban and urban students of the state. Students from many countries of the world, far and near, are now attracted to our university, and the pride they take in getting associated with our University gives us immense reasons to be proud ourselves. Students, scholars, researchers, techno-savvy men who crave for excellence in pursuing newer horizons of learning do swarm around this centre of higher education, not for no reasons.

I feel delighted, exhilarated rather, in assuming office as the Vice Chancellor of this coveted centre of higher learning. I assumed office on 12th August 2011. I am well aware of the increased responsibilities came along naturally, with this assumption. I promise you I will strive hard to bring in excellence in every administrative, academic and other associated aspects of the everyday functioning of our university.
